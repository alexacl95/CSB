# Experiments for CSB methodology

In this repository, we present the necessary codes and results to perform a validation of the CSB method using the [GSUA_CSB toolbox](https://github.com/drojasd/GSUA-CSB) in Matlab2020a. Also, we used as a study cases the dengue and COVID-19 outbreaks presented in two localities of Colombia: Amanozas department and Itaguí muniicpality. 

In the notebooks [1]() and [2](), we present the parameter estimations (model fitting) for Itaguí and Amazonas, respectively.
In notebooks [3]() and [4](), we present the CSB estimations. 

Following the structure proposed in those codes, the codes could be implemented for other data and localities.
